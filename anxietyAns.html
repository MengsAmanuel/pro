      <h2>  ANXIETY MANAGEMENT<h2>
            <h2>Steps toward managing Anxiety</h2> 
          <ol>
<li><h3>Calm Breathing:</h2></li>
This is a strategy that you can use to help reduce some of the physical symptoms <br> 
experienced during a panic attack. We tend to breathe faster when we are anxious,<br>
 which can make us feel dizzy and lightheaded, which in turn can make us even more anxious. <br>
  Calm breathing involves taking slow, regular breaths through your nose. However, <br>
  it is important to realize that the goal of calm breathing is not to stop a panic attack,<br>
   because it’s dangerous, but to make it a little easier to “ride out” the feelings. <br>
<li><h3>Muscle Relaxation:</h3></li>
Another helpful strategy involves learning to relax your body. This technique involves tensing <br>
various muscles and then relaxing them, to help lower overall tension and stress levels, which <br>
can contribute to panic attacks.
<li><h3>Realistic thinking</h3> </li>
The next tool involves learning to identify scary thoughts that can trigger and fuel physical feelings of panic. <br>
br First, ask yourself what you are afraid will happen during a panic attack. Examples include: “I will faint,” <br>
 “It will go on forever,” “I’ll embarrass myself,” “I’ll have a heart attack,” or “I’ll die.” <br>
 To become more aware of your specific fears, try to identify your thoughts (and write them down) <br>
 whenever you feel anxious or feel an urge to avoid or escape a situation. Repeat this exercise for a week or so.
<li><h3>Talk to someone you  trust:</h3></li>
<li><h3>Try to manage your worries:</h3></li>
<li><h3>Look after your physical health:</h3></li>
<li><h3>Keep a diary:</h3></li>
