           <h1>What is Stress?</h1> 
           <h3><p> Stress has a different meaning for different people under different conditions.
           The first and most generic definition </P>of stress was that proposed by Hans Selye:

           <p> It is an individual's response to change in circumstance or to a threatening situation.
            It can be viewed as a personal</P> <P>reaction to an external event like writing an exam or
           to an internal state of mind like worrying about an exam. ... </P><P>However, stress can
             spur us on to achieve our best.</p>
                         
           <p> Most of us can manage varying amounts of pressure without feeling stressed. 
            However too much or excessive</P> <P>pressure, often created by our own thinking
             patterns and life experiences, can overstretch our ability to cope and </p>
           <p>  then stress is experienced. </p>
