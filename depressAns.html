                How Is Depression Treated? </h2>
<p>
        Depression is among the most treatable of mental disorders.  <br>
          Between 80 percent and 90 percent of people with depression eventually respond well to treatment. <br>
           Almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms.
        Before a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, <br>
         including an interview and possibly a physical examination.
         <br> In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem. 
          <br> The evaluation is to identify specific symptoms, medical and family history, <br>
           cultural factors and environmental factors to arrive at a diagnosis and plan a course of action.

</p>
                    <h2>Medication:</h2>  
                    <p>Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on people not experiencing depression.
                            Antidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use. Full benefits may not be seen for two to three months. If a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant. In some situations other psychotropic medications may be helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a medication does not work or if you experience side effects.
                            Psychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take medication for six or more months after symptoms have improved. Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk of future episodes for certain people at high risk.
                          </p>  
                          <h2>Psychotherapy</h2>          
                <p>
                        Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; <br>
                         for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used in along with antidepressant medications. <br>
                          Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating depression. <br>
                           CBT is a form of therapy focused on the present and problem solving. <br>
                            CBT helps a person to recognize distorted thinking and then change behaviors and thinking. <br>
                Psychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. 
               <br> For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships. <br>
                Group therapy involves people with similar illnesses.
                Depending on the severity of the depression, <br> treatment can take a few weeks or much longer. <br>
                 In many cases, significant improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions.

                </p> 
               <h2> Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)</h2> <p>

                    is a medical treatment most commonly used for patients with severe major depression or bipolar disorder <br>
                     who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while  <br>
                     the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of <br>
                      six to 12 treatments. ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements. <br>
                       It is usually managed by a team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and  <br>
                       a nurse or physician assistant.
